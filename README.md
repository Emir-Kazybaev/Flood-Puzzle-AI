##Flood Puzzle & Artificial Intelligence

###This application offers:
- Interactive strategic puzzle called Flood
- Graphical User Interface
- Four search methods - A*, Breadth-First Search, Depth Elimination Search(DES), Breadth-First Search PLUS(BFS+)

By default, the program runs a _7x7_ puzzle with _6_ colors. In order to customize these settings uncomment lines _7, 8_ from **main.py**.

###Goal
- This application was created as a part of the final-year thesis project.
- The main aim of the research was to determine the most appropriate Artificial Intelligence algorithm in order to find the efficient solution for the Flood Puzzle.

**It's recommended to have Python 3.9 and pygame installed.**
